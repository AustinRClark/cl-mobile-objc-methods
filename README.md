# Objective-C Methods

As the name suggests, Objective-C uses a ton of objects. Most of these objects have methods that do all sorts of things. `NSString` and `NSDate` are both objects that come with the Foundation framework. 

We'll be making heavy use of Foundation objects once we start developing iOS apps so lets go ahead and get acquainted with finding and using methods on these objects. Make sure check the class references when trying searching for methods.
